Civil engineering is a professional engineering discipline that deals with the design, construction, and maintenance of the physical and naturally built environment, including public works such as roads, bridges, canals, dams, airports, sewerage systems, pipelines, structural components of buildings, and railways. Civil engineering is the application of physical and scientific principles for solving the problems of society, and its history is intricately linked to advances in the understanding of physics and mathematics throughout history. Because civil engineering is a broad profession, including several specialized sub-disciplines, its history is linked to knowledge of structures, materials science, geography, geology, soils, hydrology, environmental science, mechanics, project management, and other fields.

The Department of Civil Engineering was established in 1980 with an intake of 60 students and five faculty members. The department has been successful in producing excellent and well-trained graduates. Today, we have 320 Students from UG & PG and 45 teaching faculty drawn from premium institutes throughout India, out of whom 5 are Professors, 10 are Associate Professors and 30 are Assistant Professors. Eleven staff members have more than ten years’ experience, ten are doctorates and thirteen are pursuing PhD and ten are non-teaching Staff. The departmental activities embrace Testing, Planning, Design, Construction and Management. The department offers courses for graduates in civil engineering, postgraduates in Structural Engineering, Construction Technology and Management, and Geotechnical Engineering, also we have Ph.D. program in civil engineering discipline for those who wants to pursue research. The department offers flexible syllabus for the students for their post-graduation in specializations Structural Engineering, Geotechnical Engineering, Construction Technology and Management. The department of civil engineering has well equipped laboratories in all areas. Also, many of our alumni hold prestigious positions in leading academic institutions, industry and government in different countries all over the world.

The department offers four-year bachelor’s degree program with the below listed specializations.

The department offers two years Master’s degree in the following areas of specialization in Civil Engineering.

Doctoral Degree in Civil Engineering prepares students to acquire a systematic and critical understanding of a complex field of learning and specialised research skills in core aspects of Civil engineering to advance learning and/or professional practice. Areas of research includes structural engineering, transport engineering, geotechnical engineering, construction management and technology, water resources and environmental engineering. The department offers Full-time and Part-Time PhD program. The admissions are scheduled annually in various PhD program, and the announcement in the newspaper/website is also published.

KLEF, the metamorphosis of Koneru Lakshmaiah College of Engineering (KLCE) established in 1980, is situated on a 100-acre spacious campus with a built-up area of 18 lakhs sq.ft. on the banks of the Buckingham Canal of the Krishna River, eight kilometers from Vijayawada city in Andhra Pradesh, India. Built within a rural setting of lush Green Fields, the Institute is a virtual paradise of pristine nature and idyllic beauty. The campus has been aptly named “Green Fields” and the splendid avenue of trees and gardens bear testimony to the importance of ecology and environment. The campus ambience is most befitting for scholastic pursuits.

The new off-campus site was established in 2017 at Hyderabad, Moinabad, Aziznagar Road, near TSPA Junction, on the road leading to Chilkur Balaji temple. This temporary campus has a built-up area of 10,00,000 Sq.ft, and the permanent campus is being prepared at Bachupally.

KLEF has a memorable journey of about 42 years packed with remarkable landmark achievements. It began its sojourn as an affiliated College of the Acharya Nagarjuna University and Accredited twice by NBA also got its autonomous status in the year 2006. In 2008, the institute, as a college, scored the highest CGPA of 3.76/4.00 among engineering institutes in India in NAAC accreditation. In February 2009, the college, KLCE, through its founding society “Koneru Lakshmaiah Education Foundation” was recognized as Deemed to be University by the MHRD, Govt. of India, Under Section 3 of UGC Act 1956. Again in 2013 it was reaccredited by NAAC with ‘A’ grade. In 2018, KLEF obtained ‘A++’ Grading from NAAC during second cycle, resulting in KLEF being recognized as Category-1 University by MHRD. KLEF’s dedication towards continuous improvement reflects from securing 27th rank in NIRF University ranking in the year 2022.

To be a globally renowned university.

To impart quality higher education and to undertake research and extension with emphasis on application and innovation that cater to the emerging societal needs through all-round development of the students of all sections enabling them to be globally competitive and socially responsible citizens with intrinsic values.

Biotechnology is a cutting-edge field that merges biology with technology to develop innovative solutions for a wide range of industries. By harnessing the power of living organisms, cells, and molecular biology, biotechnology is revolutionizing sectors such as healthcare, agriculture, environmental science, and food production. In healthcare, biotechnology has led to significant advancements in the development of life-saving drugs, vaccines, and personalized medicine. Techniques such as gene editing, stem cell therapy, and diagnostic innovations are improving treatment options for diseases ranging from cancer to genetic disorders. In agriculture, biotechnology plays a crucial role in creating genetically modified crops that are more resistant to pests, diseases, and environmental stress. These innovations not only boost crop yields but also help address food security challenges by making farming more sustainable and efficient. Biotechnology is also instrumental in environmental conservation. It enables the creation of biofuels, bioremediation processes to clean up pollution, and sustainable alternatives to traditional industrial practices, thus contributing to a greener, more sustainable future. In the food industry, biotechnology helps improve food safety, enhance nutritional value, and reduce food waste through innovative preservation and processing techniques. Overall, biotechnology holds immense promise for solving global challenges and improving quality of life. Its applications are continually evolving, making it one of the most dynamic and transformative fields of the modern era. Whether advancing medicine, enhancing food production, or promoting environmental sustainability, biotechnology is shaping a brighter future for all.
